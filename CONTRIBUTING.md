# Contributing
First of all, thank you for contributing. Itâ€™s appreciated. This guide details how to use issues and pull requests to improve this project.


## Making changes
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* Add the eslint rules you want to add.
* Make commits of logical units.

### Branching
When creating a branch. Use the issue number(without the '#') as the prefix and add a short title, like: `1-commit-message-example`

### Commit message
Make sure your commit messages follow the [Angular's format](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines), try `npm run commit`:
````
    docs(contributing): make the example in contributing guidelines concrete

    The example commit message in the contributing.md document is not a concrete example. This is a problem because the
    contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like
    based on a description rather than an example. Fix the
    problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

## Creating an Issue
Before you create a new issue:
  * Check the issues on Github to ensure that one doesn't already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue, there is an [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to guide you.
